#To configure the database connection that will allows the way to do operations in the database.
#This file establishes parameters such as connection pool, database name and all related parameters.
#The connection pool in Ontimize is an element that obtains a number of connections. They are shared between requests and objects.
#This allows the logic to open, close and manage a connection to be largely hidden.
# For HSQLDB:
Driver =org.hsqldb.jdbcDriver
#URL FOR IAS:
#URL = jdbc:hsqldb:/home/IAS/DocumentosIAS/QuickStartAllComponents/db/templateDB;ifexists=true  
#URL FOR 1&1:
#URL = jdbc:hsqldb:D:/data/QuickStartAllComponents2/db/templateDB;ifexists=true  
#URL FOR Eclipse and tomcat:
URL=${database.url}
#URL = jdbc:hsqldb:hsql:~/~/localhost:9003/templateDB
User=quickstart
#Password=quickstart
E64Password=AgEIER8CAQgRHw==
Database=HSQLDB
# For PostgreSQL:
#Driver =org.postgresql.Driver
#URL = jdbc:postgresql:~/~/imatia99/ontimize_quickstart
#User=postgres
#Password=postgres1234
#Database=Postgres
#Minimum connection number that the connection pool will open in the start up:
MinimumConnections = 1
#Maximum connection number the the  connection pool will handle:
MaximumConnections = 200
#Connection number to be open when all the connections are being used:
IncreaseConnections = 5
#Max time of inactivity to close a connection:
Timeout =  600000
#Max time the connection can be blocked:
LockedTimeout = 600000
#Time, in milliseconds, between connection checking. This time must be less than LockedTimeOut:
ReleaseCycle = 10000
#Time between captures of the Server Monitor.  Optional.
UpdateCycle = 400
#To check whether the database is up. Here must be included the name for a database table. Ontimize knows when the database is shut down
#by checking this table state. So, it is possible to reconnect with database when a problem occurs:
